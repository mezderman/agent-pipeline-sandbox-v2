  "body": "Hello,\n\nI would like to request a refund for my recent purchase of wireless headphones (Order #ORD-987654). I received the product on January 17th, but unfortunately, I'm experiencing significant issues with the sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nI've already tried troubleshooting by:\n- Resetting the headphones\n- Updating the firmware\n- Testing with different devices\n\nNone of these steps resolved the issues. Given these problems, I would appreciate a full refund of $149.99.\n\nPlease let me know what additional information you need from me to process this refund.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nBest regards,\nSarah Johnson"
