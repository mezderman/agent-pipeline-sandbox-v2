Structured Outputs
==================

Ensure responses adhere to a JSON schema.

Introduction
------------

JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structured Outputs include:

1.  **Reliable type-safety:** No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
2.  **Explicit refusals:** Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
3.  **Simpler prompting:** No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting

In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/master/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) also make it easy to define object schemas using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const CalendarEvent = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  participants: z.array(z.string()),
});

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "Extract the event information." },
    { role: "user", content: "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday." },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(CalendarEvent, "event"),
});

const event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday."},
    ],
    response_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
```
